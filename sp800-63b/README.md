# SP 800-63B

This is a working draft of NIST Special Publication 800-63B *Authentication and Lifecycle Management*. This document is a sub-document referenced by [SP 800-63-3](../sp800-63-3/README.html) covering the associated topics that had been previously in SP 800-63-2.

SP 800-63B provides guidance on the selection, use, and management of authenticators (formerly called *tokens*) to authenticate a subscriber to a digital identity system at specified levels of strength.

- An identifier that can be used to associate the subscriber with previous interactions with the same relying party

- A metric describing the strength of the authentication process

- Optionally, one or more attributes associated with the subscriber
